Since the data from US Census Bureau is somewhat hectic, I simplified the data by averaging the SAT scores in each county and compared them to the average income of each county.

A scatter plot graph was used to examine the relationship between SAT scores and mean household income in the five counties of New York City. I found that results showed a strong positive correlation between the two variables, indicating that higher household income is associated with higher SAT scores. This finding suggests that there may be unequal access to education and resources in lower-income households, which could have long-term implications for social and economic mobility.
